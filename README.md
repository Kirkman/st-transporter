# Star Trek ANSI transporter effect

![Star Trek holiday animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kirkman/st-transporter/master/output/KM-TRANSPORTER-still.png)

This ANSI art animation was released in the [Blocktronics](http://www.blocktronics.org) ["Darker Image #2"](http://www.blocktronics.org/downloads/artpacks/blocktronics_darker_image_%232.zip) artpack. Artwork and code by Kirkman (Josh Renaud).

This animation features a cool transporter animation effect I cooked up. If you'd like to read more about the effect, read my 2018 blog post ["New ANSImation: Star Trek: The Trouble With The Rangifer Tarandus"](http://breakintochat.com/blog/2018/02/14/new-ansimation-star-trek-the-trouble-with-the-rangifer-tarandus/).

This animation runs in [Synchronet BBS](http://www.synchro.net) software's Javascript environment, and requires its Frame.js and Sprite.js libraries.

You can also download [the animation in ANS format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kirkman/st-transporter/master/output/KM-TRANSPORTER.ANS).
